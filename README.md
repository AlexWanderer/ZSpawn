Instalation
===========

COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Project Zomboid 2.9.9.17 (Steam version) and later

I've only tested on Mac, but it works surely on Linux/Windows.

Go to your Project Zomboid directory: <code>Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/ProjectZomboid/Project Zomboid/Contents/Resources/Java/mods</code> and drag all files from the ZSpawn folder in the corresponding PZ folder.

Run the game.
